Hi, Iâ€™m Jiarui Wu, but you can call me Jerry. I'm a student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Rochester.
I'm a cat lover, and my hobbies include programming, playing video games, traveling, and reading books.
My interests in CS topics are artificial intelligence (machine learning and deep learning), web development, blockchain, and cloud computing.
I hope to contribute to some open-source projects and also develop more of my own projects.
